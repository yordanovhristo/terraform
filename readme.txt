The project creates a scalable and reliable web application infrastructure on AWS. It consists of 2-5 EC2 instances, an RDS database, and an EFS file system. 
The instances are autoscaled to meet demand. The web application is load balanced to distribute traffic evenly across the instances. 
External access is only allowed to the load balancer on ports 80 and 443.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each component:

EC2 instances: These are virtual machines that provide the compute resources for the web application.
RDS: This is a managed relational database service that provides a scalable and reliable database for the web application.
EFS: This is a managed file system that provides shared storage for the web application.
Load balancer: This distributes traffic evenly across the EC2 instances.
Ports 80 and 443: These are the standard ports for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
